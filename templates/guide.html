                <h5>What is Keto Diet?</h5>
                <p class="diet-overview">
                    The ketogenic (keto) diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been claimed to help
                    people lose
                    weight. The
                    primary idea behind the keto diet is to get your body into a state of ketosis, where it's
                    burning fat
                    for fuel instead
                    of carbohydrates.
